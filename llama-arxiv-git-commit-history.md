# Git Commit History Plan for Llama-Arxiv

Below is a suggested series of commits for developing the Llama-Arxiv project. This sequence demonstrates thoughtful, incremental development with well-structured commit messages following best practices.

## Initial Setup

```
Initial commit: Project structure and basic setup

This commit establishes the foundational structure for the Llama-Arxiv project,
a Rust-based arXiv paper downloader and processor. It includes:

- Project directory structure
- Cargo.toml with dependencies
- Basic module architecture
- CLI argument parsing
- Error handling structure
- Setup and build scripts

The goal is to create a robust, extensible tool for researchers to manage 
academic papers from arXiv more efficiently.

## Core Functionality Implementation

```
feat(arxiv): Implement arXiv API client

Add functionality to fetch paper metadata from the arXiv API:
- Create HTTP client with proper user agent and timeout handling
- Parse XML responses into Rust structures
- Extract title, authors, abstract, and other metadata
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Add unit tests for API response parsing

This enables the core functionality of retrieving paper information
by arXiv ID or URL.

```
feat(download): Add PDF download functionality

Implement the PDF download module with:
- Asynchronous download with progress tracking
- Proper error handling for network issues
- Configurable output directory
- File existence checks to avoid redundant downloads
- Integration with the metadata module for filename generation

This allows users to download papers once metadata is retrieved.

```
feat(parser): Add PDF text extraction

Implement PDF parsing functionality:
- Add PDFium-based text extraction (with feature flag)
- Create fallback mechanism when PDFium isn't available
- Implement basic text cleaning and formatting
- Add utilities for different output formats (text, HTML, markdown)
- Integrate with the main workflow

This enables users to extract and process the content of downloaded papers.

```
feat(config): Add configuration system

Implement TOML-based configuration:
- Create configuration data structures
- Add file loading/saving functionality
- Set sensible defaults for all options
- Integrate with command-line arguments
- Document configuration options

This allows users to customize the behavior of the application
without having to specify options on every run.

## Testing and Refinement

```
test: Add integration tests

Add comprehensive integration tests:
- Test API fetch + PDF download workflow
- Create temporary test directories
- Validate downloaded files
- Test error handling scenarios
- Add CI configuration for automated testing

These tests ensure the components work together properly
and verify the end-to-end functionality.

```
refactor: Improve error handling

Enhance the error handling system:
- Create more specific error types
- Improve error messages for better user feedback
- Add context to error chains
- Ensure proper cleanup on error
- Add logging for debug purposes

This improves the user experience when things go wrong and
makes the application more robust.

## Enhancements

```
feat(citation): Add BibTeX citation extraction

Implement citation extraction functionality:
- Add regex-based BibTeX detection in PDF text
- Create fallback citation generation from metadata
- Add proper formatting and cleaning
- Make citation extraction optional via CLI flag
- Add tests for various citation formats

This helps researchers easily cite papers in their own work.

```
feat(ui): Improve progress indicators and console output

Enhance the user interface:
- Add colorized console output
- Improve progress bars for downloads
- Create better formatting for metadata display
- Add summary statistics after operations
- Implement verbose mode for debugging

These changes make the tool more pleasant and informative to use.

## Documentation and Polish

```
docs: Add comprehensive documentation

Improve project documentation:
- Create detailed README with examples
- Add API documentation with examples
- Document the project architecture
- Include installation instructions for different platforms
- Create example configuration files

Good documentation makes the tool more accessible to users
and contributors.

chore: Prepare for 0.4.0 release

Final preparations for release:
- Update version number in Cargo.toml
- Ensure all tests pass on multiple platforms
- Clean up code and remove unused dependencies
- Update GitHub Actions workflow for releases
- Verify packaging for crates.io

This release provides a stable, feature-complete tool for
downloading and processing arXiv papers.

## Future Enhancement Commits

For ongoing development after the initial release:

```
feat(storage): Add SQLite database for paper management

Implement a local database to track downloaded papers:
- Create SQLite schema for paper metadata
- Add functionality to query and filter papers
- Implement paper list management commands
- Add export functionality for metadata
- Ensure backward compatibility with file-based storage

This enhancement helps users manage larger collections of papers.

```
feat(search): Add full-text search across papers

Implement search functionality:
- Create text indexing for downloaded papers
- Add search commands to the CLI
- Implement relevance ranking for results
- Add snippet generation for context
- Create search result export options

This feature helps researchers find relevant information across
their paper collection.
