# llama-moonlight-finance: Technical Overview

## Architecture

`llama-moonlight-finance` is designed with a flexible, modular architecture that enables integration with multiple financial data providers and trading platforms. The architecture follows these key design principles:

1. **Provider Abstraction**: All external data sources and trading platforms are abstracted behind common interfaces.
2. **Rich Domain Model**: Financial entities are represented with comprehensive domain models.
3. **Extensibility**: The system is designed to be easily extended with new providers and capabilities.
4. **Asynchronous by Default**: All operations that involve network or potentially long-running tasks are async.
5. **Type Safety**: Rust's strong type system is leveraged to prevent runtime errors.

### Core Components

1. **Client Layer**
   - `FinanceClient`: The main entry point for users
   - `ClientConfig`: Configurable client settings
   - Provider management and request routing

2. **Provider Layer**
   - `Provider` trait: Common interface for all providers
   - `DataProvider` trait: Interface for market data providers
   - `TradingProvider` trait: Interface for trading platforms

3. **Data Layer**

   - Statistical analysis of price data
   - Pattern recognition

7. **Portfolio Layer**
   - Portfolio management
   - Performance tracking and analysis
   - Asset allocation models

8. **Stealth/Privacy Layer**

## Key Implementation Details

### Provider System

The provider system is a key architectural component of the library. It uses Rust's trait system to define common interfaces that all providers must implement:

```rust
pub trait Provider {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn provider_type(&self) -> ProviderType;
    fn capabilities(&self) -> Vec<Capability>;
    fn as_data_provider(&self) -> Option<Arc<dyn DataProvider>>;
    fn as_trading_provider(&self) -> Option<Arc<dyn TradingProvider>>;
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait DataProvider: Provider + Send + Sync {
    async fn quote(&self, symbol: &str) -> Result<Quote>;
    async fn quotes(&self, symbols: &[&str]) -> Result<HashMap<String, Quote>>;
    async fn historical_prices(...) -> Result<TimeSeries<Price>>;
    async fn search(&self, query: &str, asset_class: Option<AssetClass>) -> Result<Vec<MarketData>>;
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait TradingProvider: Provider + Send + Sync {
    async fn order_book(&self, symbol: &str, depth: Option<u32>) -> Result<OrderBook>;
    async fn place_order(&self, order: Order) -> Result<OrderStatus>;
    async fn cancel_order(&self, order_id: &str) -> Result<bool>;
    async fn positions(&self) -> Result<Vec<Position>>;
}
```

This design allows:
1. **Composition**: A provider can implement multiple traits
2. **Discovery**: Capabilities can be queried at runtime
3. **Type Erasure**: The client can store heterogeneous providers

### Client Design

The `FinanceClient` uses a builder pattern for configuration and initialization:

```rust
let client = FinanceClient::new()
    .with_provider(YahooProvider::default())
    .with_provider(AlphaVantageProvider::new("API_KEY"))
    .with_default_data_provider("yahoo")
    .build();
```

Internally, it uses:
- Generic request handling with retry logic
- Provider selection based on capabilities
- Rate limiting to respect API quotas
- Centralized error handling

### Time Series Processing

The `TimeSeries<T>` type is a flexible container for time-based data, with specialized implementations for financial price data:

```rust
pub struct TimeSeries<T> {
    pub symbol: String,
    pub interval: TimeInterval,
    pub prices: Vec<T>,
    pub start_time: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub end_time: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub timezone: String,
    pub currency: String,
}
```

For price data, it implements various statistical methods and technical indicators directly on the time series object.

### Trading System

The trading system models order flow with these core types:

- `Order`: Represents a trading order request
- `OrderStatus`: Represents the current status of an order
- `TradeExecution`: Represents a single execution of an order
- `Position`: Represents a current trading position

The system is designed to be flexible enough to support different order types, trading venues, and asset classes.

### Error Handling

The library uses a custom `Error` enum with thiserror for detailed error reporting:

```rust
#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum Error {
    #[error("Provider error: {0}")]
    ProviderError(String),
    
    #[error("Market data error: {0}")]
    MarketDataError(String),
    
    #[error("Trading error: {0}")]
    TradingError(String),
    
    // Additional error types...
}
```

This enables pinpointing the source of errors, retrying where appropriate, and providing helpful messages to users.

## Integration Points

### llama-moonlight-headers

When available, integrates with `llama-moonlight-headers` to generate realistic browser-like headers to avoid detection.

### llama-moonlight-stealth

With the `stealth` feature enabled, integrates with `llama-moonlight-stealth` to provide additional detection avoidance:
- Browser fingerprint randomization
- Request pattern normalization
- IP rotation strategies

### llama-moonlight-tor

With the `tor` feature enabled, integrates with `llama-moonlight-tor` to provide:
- Anonymous browsing through Tor
- Circuit management
- Identity rotation

## Testing Strategy

The library includes several levels of testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Every module includes unit tests for isolated functionality.
2. **Integration Tests**: Cross-module functionality is tested with integration tests.
3. **Mock Providers**: Test providers that return predictable data for testing client code.
4. **Benchmarks**: Performance-critical parts have benchmarks to detect regressions.

## Performance Considerations

The library is designed with performance in mind:

1. **Connection Pooling**: HTTP connections are reused when possible.
2. **Lazy Loading**: Heavy resources are only loaded when needed.
3. **Caching**: Responses can be cached to minimize API calls.
4. **Paging**: Large datasets are handled with pagination to control memory usage.
5. **Parallel Processing**: Where appropriate, parallel processing is used with Rayon.

## Security Considerations

Several security features are implemented:

1. **API Key Management**: API keys are securely handled.
2. **Credential Handling**: Trading credentials are treated with appropriate caution.
3. **TLS Verification**: Proper certificate validation is enforced.
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents accidental API abuse.
5. **Optional Tor Support**: For maximum privacy.

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. **Enhanced Streaming**: More sophisticated WebSocket support for real-time data.
2. **Alternative Data Integration**: Support for sentiment, news, and other alternative data.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Integration with ML models for prediction.
4. **Expanded Asset Classes**: Better support for forex, options, and futures.
5. **Expanded Screening**: More sophisticated market screening tools.
6. **Historical Backtesting**: More comprehensive backtesting framework.
7. **Enhanced Charting**: More sophisticated chart generation.

## Design Trade-offs

Key design trade-offs in the library include:

1. **Flexibility vs. Simplicity**: The provider abstraction adds complexity but enables greater flexibility.
2. **Memory vs. Requests**: Caching strategies balance memory usage against API request reduction.
3. **Generic vs. Specialized**: Some components are generic while others are specialized for specific use cases.
4. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**: The library is primarily async which adds complexity but improves efficiency.
5. **Feature Gating**: Many advanced features are behind feature gates to keep the core library lean.

These trade-offs were made to balance the needs of different users, from those requiring simple data access to those building sophisticated trading systems.
