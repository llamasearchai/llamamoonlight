## Core Components

### 1. TorClient (client.rs)

The `TorClient` is the main entry point for most users, providing a high-level HTTP client that routes all traffic through the Tor network. Key features include:

- HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Identity rotation (new Tor circuits)
- Request customization (headers, timeout)
- Onion service access
- Connection verification
- Integrated SOCKS proxy configuration

The client handles all complexity of the Tor network internally, providing a clean and simple interface inspired by reqwest, but with added Tor-specific features.

### 2. Circuit Management (circuit.rs)

The `TorCircuit` module manages Tor circuits, including:

- Circuit creation and management
- Circuit information tracking
- Exit node selection
- Country-based routing configuration
- Identity rotation

Each circuit is tracked with a `CircuitInfo` struct containing detailed information about the path through the Tor network, including node information, countries traversed, and status.

### 3. Tor Controller (controller.rs)

The `TorController` provides a direct interface to the Tor control protocol, allowing:

- Control port communication
- Authentication handling
- Circuit creation commands
- Signal handling (new identity)
- Tor process management
- Information retrieval

This module is the core interface between the Rust code and the Tor software, handling all control protocol communication.

### 4. Onion Service Handling (onion.rs)

The `OnionService` module provides functionality for working with onion services (hidden services), including:

- Service discovery
- Metadata extraction and management
- Service health checking
- Categorization and tagging
- Response time tracking

The `OnionMetadata` struct captures detailed information about onion services, including title, description, keywords, and status information.

### 5. Proxy Integration (proxy.rs)

The `TorProxy` module handles SOCKS proxy integration:

- SOCKS5 protocol management
- Proxy connection handling
- Tor process launching and management
- Connection health checking
- Configuration management

This module manages the connection between the HTTP client and the Tor SOCKS proxy, handling connection setup and management.

### 6. Dark Web Search (search.rs)

The `DarkWebSearch` module provides dark web search capabilities:

- Aggregation across multiple search engines
- Result caching and deduplication
- Result ranking and sorting
- Service verification
- Metadata enrichment

The module includes parsers for popular dark web search engines like Ahmia, Torch, NotEvil, and Phobos, with a pluggable architecture for adding additional engines.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- Circuit isolation
- Traffic anonymization

### 4. Developer-Friendly API

- Intuitive, high-level HTTP client
- Comprehensive error handling
- Async/await support
- Type-safe interfaces

### 5. Performance Optimizations

- Result caching
- Connection pooling
- Concurrent request handling
- Request batching

## Integration with Llama Moonlight Ecosystem

This crate is designed to integrate with the broader Llama Moonlight ecosystem:

- **llama-moonlight-core**: Provides core browser automation capabilities
- **llama-moonlight-headers**: Generates realistic browser headers for stealth
- **llama-moonlight-stealth**: Implements anti-detection and fingerprinting protection

Together, these crates form a comprehensive ecosystem for privacy-focused web automation, with `llama-moonlight-tor` providing the Tor network integration layer.

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling

The crate uses the `thiserror` crate for comprehensive error handling, with a custom `Error` enum that provides detailed error information. All operations return `Result<T, Error>` types, allowing for proper error propagation.

### Async Runtime

The crate is built on Tokio for asynchronous operation, providing non-blocking I/O and efficient resource usage. Most public functions are async and return Futures.

### Configuration

Configuration is handled through the `TorConfig` struct, which provides comprehensive options for customizing Tor behavior, including:

- Data directory location
- SOCKS and control port settings
- Exit node selection
- Bridge configuration
- Timeout settings

### Testing Strategy

The crate includes comprehensive unit tests for each module, with integration tests for key components. Testing includes:

- Mock Tor responses for control protocol testing
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Property-based testing for complex behaviors

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Request Flow

1. Create a `TorConfig` with desired settings
2. Instantiate a `TorClient` with the config
3. Call `init()` to establish Tor connection
4. Issue HTTP requests through the client's methods
5. Optionally rotate identity to change circuits

### Dark Web Search Flow

1. Create a `TorClient` and initialize it
2. Create a `DarkWebSearch` with the client
3. Issue search queries through the `search()` method
4. Process and filter results
5. Optionally verify results and extract metadata

### Onion Service Access

1. Create a `TorClient` and initialize it
2. Use the client's `access_onion()` method or create an `OnionService`
3. Extract metadata and process responses
4. Track service status and metadata

## Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **Tor Availability**: The crate handles Tor process management, but also supports connecting to existing Tor instances.

2. **Performance vs. Anonymity**: Configurable settings for circuit rotation frequency allow balancing performance and anonymity.

3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types provide detailed information about failures.

4. **Concurrency**: Tokio-based async design handles concurrent requests efficiently.

5. **Resource Management**: Careful resource tracking and cleanup ensures proper operation.

## Future Directions

Potential areas for future enhancement include:

1. **Additional Search Engines**: Adding support for more dark web search engines
2. **Onion Service Hosting**: Support for hosting onion services
3. **Enhanced Metadata Collection**: More comprehensive metadata extraction
4. **Machine Learning Integration**: For result ranking and classification
5. **Browser Integration**: Closer integration with browser automation

## Conclusion

The `llama-moonlight-tor` crate provides a comprehensive solution for Tor network integration in Rust applications, with a focus on ease of use, security, and integration with the Llama Moonlight ecosystem. Its modular design and comprehensive feature set make it suitable for a wide range of privacy-focused applications.
