# llama-moonlight-reddit: Technical Overview

## Architecture

The `llama-moonlight-reddit` crate is designed with a modular, layered architecture to provide both ease of use and flexibility for advanced use cases.

### Core Components

1. **Client Layer**
   - `RedditClient`: The main entry point for users
   - `ClientConfig`: Configuration options for the client
   - HTTP request handling and response processing

2. **Authentication Layer**
   - `Authenticator`: Handles OAuth2 authentication flows
   - `TokenStore`: Interface for token persistence
   - `Credentials`: Different credential types for authentication

3. **Model Layer**
   - Strongly typed models for all Reddit entities (Post, Comment, Subreddit, etc.)
   - Serialization/deserialization using Serde
   - Type-safe enums for Reddit concepts (ThingKind, Sort, etc.)

4. **API Interface Layer**
   - Domain-specific clients (SubredditClient, UserClient, etc.)
   - Fluent builders for complex requests (ListingBuilder, SearchBuilder)
   - Rate limiting and throttling

5. **Feature-Specific Modules**
   - Stealth capabilities (with stealth feature)
   - Tor integration (with tor feature)
   - Browser automation helpers (with browser feature)

## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication

The library implements multiple OAuth2 flows:

1. **Password Flow**: Username/password authentication for script applications
2. **Client Credentials Flow**: For applications acting on their own behalf
3. **Refresh Token Flow**: For maintaining long-lived sessions
4. **Application-Only Flow**: For installed applications

Tokens are managed through the `TokenStore` trait, with an in-memory implementation provided by default and the ability to add custom persistent stores.

### HTTP Layer

The HTTP layer is built on reqwest with careful handling of:

- Request preparation and authentication headers
- Error handling and response parsing
- Rate limit detection and adherence
- Connection pooling and reuse

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Client-side proactive rate limiting**: Using the `RateLimiter` to respect Reddit's published limits
2. **Response header monitoring**: Adjusting rate limits based on `x-ratelimit-*` headers from Reddit
3. **Endpoint-specific rate limiting**: Different thresholds for different endpoints (posting, voting, etc.)
4. **Retry mechanisms**: Smart retries with exponential backoff for recoverable errors

### Builder Pattern

The library makes extensive use of the builder pattern for creating fluent, intuitive APIs:

```rust
// Example of builder pattern for fetching posts
client.subreddit("rust")
    .top()
    .time(TimeRange::Week)
    .limit(25)
    .after("t3_abcdef")
    .fetch()
    .await
```

This provides a chainable, self-documenting API while still maintaining type safety.

### Error Handling

Errors are handled through a custom `Error` enum that categorizes different failure modes:

- Authentication errors
- API errors (with status code and message)
- Rate limit errors
- Parsing errors
- Network errors
- Feature-specific errors (Tor, browser, etc.)

All public functions return a `Result<T, Error>` to propagate these errors properly.

### Concurrency

The library is designed for concurrent use:

- Uses `tokio` for async/await support
- Thread-safe structures with proper interior mutability (`Arc<Mutex<T>>`, `Arc<RwLock<T>>`)
- Careful handling of shared state
- Atomic operations where appropriate

## Integration Points

### llama-moonlight-headers

When the `llama-moonlight-headers` crate is available, it is used to generate realistic browser-like headers to avoid detection.

### llama-moonlight-stealth

When the `stealth` feature is enabled, the library integrates with `llama-moonlight-stealth` to provide advanced detection avoidance:

- Browser fingerprint randomization
- Request pattern normalization
- Behavior randomization

### llama-moonlight-tor

When the `tor` feature is enabled, the library integrates with `llama-moonlight-tor` to provide:

- Anonymous browsing through Tor
- Circuit isolation
- Identity rotation

## Testing Strategy

The library includes:

1. **Unit tests**: For individual components and utilities
2. **Integration tests**: For end-to-end workflows
3. **Mock API tests**: Using the `mock` feature to test against a fake Reddit API
4. **Property-based tests**: For complex data handling and transformations

## Performance Considerations

Several optimizations are implemented:

1. **Connection pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections
2. **Response caching**: Cache common responses
3. **Lazy loading**: Defer expensive operations until needed
4. **Pagination handling**: Efficient handling of large result sets
5. **Streaming API**: Memory-efficient handling of real-time updates

## Security Considerations

Security measures include:

1. **Token handling**: Secure storage and transmission of authentication tokens
2. **Credential management**: Proper handling of sensitive credentials
3. **TLS verification**: Proper certificate validation
4. **Proxy support**: For enhanced privacy

## Future Directions

Planned enhancements include:

1. **Enhanced caching**: More sophisticated caching strategies
2. **Webhook support**: For Reddit's webhook notifications
3. **Push streaming**: For real-time updates
4. **GraphQL support**: For Reddit's emerging GraphQL API
5. **Enhanced analytics**: For tracking API usage patterns
